# 🚀 Getting Started with Multi-Tenant POS System

## Quick Start (5 minutes to running system)

### Step 1: Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g supabase

# Start local Supabase instance
supabase start
```

### Step 2: Run the System
```bash
# From the project root directory
./setup.sh
```

That's it! The setup script handles everything automatically:
- ✅ Runs database migrations
- ✅ Installs all dependencies
- ✅ Builds the backend
- ✅ Starts both backend and frontend

### Step 3: Access the System
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3001

### Step 4: Login
```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: Admin123!
```

## What You Get Out of the Box

### 🔐 Complete Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Multi-tenant data isolation using PostgreSQL RLS
- Role-based access control (Super Admin, Owner, Manager, Cashier)
- Preset super-admin account ready for use

### 🏗️ Solid Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Vite
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Multi-tenant**: Complete data isolation between businesses

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Secure JWT token management

### 📊 Database Schema
Complete schema with all necessary tables:
- `business` - Tenant management
- `user` - User accounts with role-based access
- `product` - Inventory management
- `sale` & `sale_item` - Transaction processing
- `audit_log` - System audit trail
- `refresh_token` - JWT token management

## Testing the System

Run the integration test to verify everything works:
```bash
# Start the system first
./setup.sh

# In another terminal, run tests
./test-system.sh
```

## Next Steps (MVP Extension)

The core system is ready. Here's what you can build next:

### 1. Business Management (Super Admin)
- Create/edit/delete businesses
- Assign owners to businesses
- Business statistics dashboard

### 2. User Management
- Add users to businesses with specific roles
- User permissions and role changes
- User activity tracking

### 3. Inventory Module
- Product CRUD operations
- Category management
- Stock tracking and alerts
- Low-stock notifications

### 4. Sales Module
- Point of sale interface
- Cash transaction processing
- Receipt generation
- Daily sales reports

### 5. Dashboard & Analytics
- Sales KPIs and metrics
- Revenue charts and trends
- Product performance analytics
- Business insights

## Production Considerations

When deploying to production:

1. **Security**: Change all default passwords and JWT secrets
2. **Database**: Use a production PostgreSQL instance
3. **SSL**: Enable HTTPS for all connections
4. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and health monitoring
5. **Backup**: Configure automated database backups
